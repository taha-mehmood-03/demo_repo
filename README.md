## 🚀 **Job Hunt Tips That Actually Work**

### 🔍 **Research Before Applying**

- **Find the hiring manager:** Search "[Company] [Team] engineering manager" on LinkedIn.
- **Check recent tech decisions:** Read their engineering blog for stack changes or new initiatives.
- **Verify visa requirements:** Look for 🇺🇸 indicator or "US persons only" in job description.
- [Use this 100% ATS-compliant and job-targeted resume template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eGqU7E9if-d1VoWWWts79CT-LzbJsfeZ/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=108189138560979620587&rtpof=true&sd=true).

### 📄 **Resume Best Practices**

- **Mirror their tech stack:** Copy exact keywords from job post (React, Django, Node.js, etc.).
- **Lead with business impact:** "Improved app speed by 30%" > "Used JavaScript."
- **Show product familiarity:** "Built Netflix-style recommendation engine" or "Created Stripe payment integration."
- [Read this informative guide on tweaking your resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ngAUd7fKO4eV39SBgQdA8nHw_lJIngu/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=108189138560979620587&rtpof=true&sd=true).

### 🎯 **Interview Best Practices**

- **Ask tech-specific questions:** "How do you handle CI/CD at scale?" shows real research.
- **Prepare failure stories:** "Migration failed, learned X, rebuilt with Y" demonstrates growth mindset.
- **Reference their products:** "As a daily Slack user, I've noticed..." proves genuine interest.
- [Review this comprehensive interview guide on common behavioral, technical, and curveball questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LU4kSNRu0JNiWG5CNPRp0kgzAhq27VHy/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=108189138560979620587&rtpof=true&sd=true).
