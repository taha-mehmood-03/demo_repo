- **Verify visa requirements:** Look for 🇺🇸 indicator or "US persons only" in job description.
- Use this [100% ATS-compliant and job-targeted resume template](#https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eGqU7E9if-d1VoWWWts79CT-LzbJsfeZ/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=108189138560979620587&rtpof=true&sd=true).

### 📄 **Resume Best Practices**

- **Mirror their tech stack:** Copy exact keywords from job post (React, Django, Node.js, etc.).
